Database models for Users, Departments, Appointments, Treatments, DoctorAvailability

Secure password hashing using werkzeug.security

🛠 Technology & Stack

Python 3.x

Flask (Web framework)

Flask‑SQLAlchemy (ORM)

SQL database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)

HTML templates for front end (with Flask render_template)

Password hashing via werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash / check_password_hash

🔧 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed

Virtual environment recommended

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/24f1001665/hospital-management-system.git
cd hospital-management-system



Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Initialize the database (example):

python app.py   # The `init_db()` call will create tables

Start the server:

python app.py

Open your browser at http://localhost:5000

✅ Usage / Workflow

Admin logs in → can add/edit doctors & departments

Patient logs in → browses doctors (by name or department) → books an appointment

Doctor logs in → sees upcoming appointments (next 7 days) → clicks patient → views their appointment history & treatments

🛡 Security & Best Practices

Passwords are stored hashed (never plain text)

Timestamps stored in UTC (datetime.utcnow())

Use @role_required(...) decorators to enforce role-based access

Important: For production, set FLASK_DEBUG=False and use a production-ready web server

Use environment variables (not hard-coded) for secret keys, database URLs
